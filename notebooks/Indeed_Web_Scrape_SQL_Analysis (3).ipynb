    "Snap’s highest-paying job category — “AI roles” with an average max salary of $323K — also dominates Reddit engagement. These roles received 500+ Reddit posts with an average score of 599 and over 115 comments per post. This shows clear public attention aligned with Snap’s investment priorities. Marketing roles, though still funded well, show no real online traction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**  \n",
    "Snap should continue focusing hiring and public communication around its AI initiatives. The strong overlap between salary and public buzz suggests these roles are high-profile. However, for underrepresented areas like marketing, Snap might need to re-evaluate messaging, job visibility, or consider cross-promoting open roles on platforms where tech workers gather.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction:**  \n",
    "If Snap keeps prioritizing AI/ML roles, online visibility and reputation in this space will remain strong. But failure to build similar visibility for other departments could lead to hiring slowdowns or perception gaps, especially for roles that lack buzz or aren’t talked about in key online communities."

    "**Insight:**  \n",
    "Principal-level roles at Snap average a $414K max salary with a $179K spread which is the widest and highest of all levels. Staff roles follow at $343K with a $148K spread. Senior roles average $270K, with a 27% jump to Staff and another 21% jump to Principal. Understanding how salaries shift across levels reveals Snap’s investment in leadership — wider spreads may reflect flexibility, but also signal unclear role scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**  \n",
    "Snap should clarify expectations and compensation structure at each seniority level. Transparency on salary bands and role responsibilities will reduce candidate uncertainty and build trust during negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction:**  \n",
    "Without clearer benchmarks, senior candidates may second-guess offer value or role clarity. As Snap scales its AI/ML efforts, structured compensation communication will be essential to attract and close top-tier leadership.\n"
