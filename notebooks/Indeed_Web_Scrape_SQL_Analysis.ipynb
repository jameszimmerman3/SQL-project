    "**Insight:**  \n",
    "Snap’s highest-paying job category — “AI/ML roles” with an average max salary of $323K — also dominates Reddit engagement. These roles received over **1,300 posts** with an **average score of 623** and **116 comments per post**, far exceeding all other categories. This strong alignment suggests Snap’s AI investments are not only substantial but also highly visible and well-received by the tech community. Other categories like “research” and “marketing” show decent compensation but far lower public traction, while “data” roles show almost no engagement despite strong pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**  \n",
    "Snap should double down on hiring and brand messaging for AI/ML roles, leveraging the clear enthusiasm in online communities. At the same time, Snap should investigate why high-paying but lower-engagement roles like “data” or “marketing” are underrepresented online — whether due to lack of visibility, weaker brand associations, or job descriptions that don’t resonate with tech audiences. Cross-functional campaigns or insider spotlights may help elevate those categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction:**  \n",
    "Snap’s public identity in AI will likely continue to strengthen if current hiring and discussion trends hold. However, without similar visibility-building efforts in less-hyped departments, Snap risks developing hiring bottlenecks or leaving certain teams talent-starved — not because of compensation, but because no one’s talking about them."

    "**Insight:**  \n",
    "Snap’s **Staff-level roles** show the largest jump in average salary, rising **27% from Senior to Staff** ($270K → $343K). Principal roles continue upward to **$414K** with the **widest spread ($179K)**, suggesting more flexible or negotiable comp at the top. This tiered structure reflects Snap’s growing investment in technical leadership, but wide spreads may signal inconsistency in expectations or scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**  \n",
    "Snap should clearly define compensation bands and expectations at each leadership tier. Roles like Principal with large spreads may need tighter guidelines or communication to help candidates understand their value and performance targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction:**  \n",
    "Without increased clarity, Snap risks slower closes for senior candidates or internal equity concerns. As leadership hiring accelerates—especially in AI/ML—structured comp practices will be key to attracting and retaining top talent.\n"
