## Tech Stack

- Python (PRAW, Pandas)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- AWS RDS
- dbt (staging and warehouse models)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)
- Looker Studio (visualizations)
- Markdown / Git

## Project Objective

**Who are you helping:**  
Snap Inc.'s Data Science and Talent Strategy teams

**What problem are you solving:**  
Misalignment between public perception and Snap's actual hiring priorities can slow recruiting and reduce offer acceptance.

**How are you solving it:**  
By comparing Reddit sentiment (API) and Indeed job listings (web scrape) to identify high-ROI focus areas and communication gaps using Python, SQL, dbt, and visualization tools.

## Job Description

This project was inspired by a **Data Scientist role at Snap Inc.**, focused on using data insights to inform product and business strategy. The role emphasizes statistical modeling, product trend discovery, and stakeholder communication ‚Äî all mirrored in this project's goal of aligning hiring data with public sentiment.

## Notebooks / Python Scripts

- [`API_Extract_Load_Raw.ipynb`](./notebooks/API_Extract_Load_Raw.ipynb): Pulls Reddit posts using PRAW and uploads to PostgreSQL  
- [`Web_Scrape_Extract_Load_Raw.ipynb`](./notebooks/Web_Scrape_Extract_Load_Raw.ipynb): Scrapes Indeed job descriptions and uploads to PostgreSQL  
- [`API_SQL_Analysis.ipynb`](./notebooks/API_SQL_Analysis.ipynb): Tags posts by topic, ranks themes by score, comments, and era  
- [`Web_Scrape_SQL_Analysis.ipynb`](./notebooks/Web_Scrape_SQL_Analysis.ipynb): Parses salary, tags seniority and role type, calculates heat index and salary growth

## Future Improvements

- Add NLP sentiment analysis using VADER or TextBlob  
- Visualize time-series shifts in Reddit engagement using Looker or Tableau
